for building tiles:
export to png and make sure each tile is 16X16 without spaces between the tiles.
add to png to unity
make pixels per unit 16, fiter mode to point and compression to none
apply and open in sprite editor
in there make sure the slice is 16x16 and slice
create a tile palette(can do in Window->2D->Tile palette) and add the png to it
then you can select each tile to paint, remember to use the grid and tilemaps in a correct order(ground->walkway->rails->...)
