LADYLAKE: OUCH!!!!!
LADYLAKE: WE SAID GO ON 3
HERO: The element of suprise is the best
LADYLAKE: What are you talking about? 
LADYLAKE: Actually never mind that, what the hell are you wearing?
HERO: Oh this? this is my mighty and shiny armor, cool huh?
LADYLAKE: What? Are you like one of those weird cosplayers?
HERO: What is a cosplayer? I'll let you know I am a knight, and a good one at that
LADYLAKE: Whatever helps you sleep buddy
LADYLAKE: So anyway what are you doing here "mighty knight"? came for a convention?
HERO: stop with the sarcasm, and actually I don't know how I got here
HERO: I was with my friend Merlin and then woke up here
LADYLAKE: You took one hell of a drug if you don't remember anything
HERO: I don't consume any drugs for your information
LADYLAKE: Sure, you're just a knight that was with his friend, then woke up in a field and spoke to a lake
HERO: I don't see any problems with that
LADYLAKE: That is another problem
LADYLAKE: Listen you did help me so I'll try to help you, there is a town nearby, your friend could be there
HERO: Which way is the town?
LADYLAKE: Just go south, you can't miss it
HERO: Thanks, good luck with your trash hunting or whatever you're doing getting stuck at trash cans
LADYLAKE: It's called 'trash diving' just so you know
LADYLAKE: Also the lake may not be magical but it's water are good to drink from
HERO: I'll check it out, anyway must go now
HERO: See ya later, maybe
