HERO: Who do you think you are talking to? 
POLICEMAN: To some cosplayer, apparently
HERO: I'M NOT A COSPLAYER, I'M A KNIGHT
POLICEMAN: Yes and I keep the law, we all tell ourselfs lies
HERO: Whatever, listen I need to pass to go find Merlin
POLICEMAN: Can't let anyone in, orders from above
HERO: Why?
POLICEMAN: Don't know, they wouldn't say
HERO: Listen is there a way you can let me in?
POLICEMAN: Well ... there is some way ...
HERO: What do I need to do?
POLICEMAN: If you can find me a good beer glass I'll let you go
HERO: What kind of beer glass?
POLICEMAN: Well you see I'm a beer enthusiast so I'll need a special glass, one that I've never seen before
HERO: A special beer glass you say, fine I'm up for a challenge
HERO: I, !name!, will find the holy grail of beer glasses for you dear sir, even if my life depended on it
POLICEMAN: No need for the theatrics, but that's the spirit
HERO: Ok, now where the hell can I find that glass?
HERO: Should probably go talk to the lady by the lake, she may know
